            Tissue regeneration is the regrowth of a damaged
            or missing organ part from the remaining tissue. Ability to regenerate large parts of an organisms is
            related to complexity. <p id="underline">Lower developed the animal the better the regeneration capability</p>. Salamanders are capable of regenerating entire
            limbs. Facilitated by de-differentiation of mesenchymal
            cells (muscle, cartilage, bone) to blastemal cells. Cells in the blastema proliferate and re-differentiate
            to regenerate the limb. <p id="line-through">Human regeneration capacity more limited. Certain tissues do have capacity to regenerate (e.g.
                liver, bone, connective tissue)</p>

            This dynamic process ensures that the intestinal epithelium is
            constantly replenished, maintaining the integrity of the barrier
            function and supporting efficient nutrient absorption. It also
            plays a crucial role in responding to injuries or infections,
            promoting rapid repair and recovery of the intestinal tissue.
